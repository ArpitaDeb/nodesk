# Node.js Saskatoon

This project is to learn HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js and MongoDB. Exercises were worked on here very loosely - this repo is only kept as a sandbox and should not be judged too seriously!

1. [HTML Exercises](html)
2. [CSS Exercises](css)
3. [Javascript Exercises](js)
4. [Browser API Exercises](browserAPI)
5. [Node Exercises](node_exercises)
